# Welcome to LocaLibre

The WebUI for managing Web games!

**The Problem**: I find a great web game on itch.io that I want to download and play. I get the game and try to open the `index.html` but I get an asset loading error or something like that and I can't play the game!

**Before LocaLibre**: I have to already have Python or NPX to start a local server in another window, then launch localhost and hope that the game I opened on my server is the right index.html and not some other file from another web game.

**With LocaLibre**: LocaLibre takes care of all the hard work so you can get right to playing games!
- Manages all the overhead of hosting a Web game locally
- Creates a space to view and organize local games outside your local file explorer / finder
- Filter and sort games based on genre and game tags
- Create collections of games for better organization
- See all your game data: Developer / publisher, name, image, description, date uploaded, last date played, tags, genre, etc.
- Tracks play time and other game metadata so you can stay informed about what and how you play
- Multiple user profiles help organize games if you're sharing your machine with family or friends

# In Development

**LocaLibre** is still very much in-development and will remain that way as the list of features grows. However, my goal is to create a polished and robust local game library to help you play your favorite web games.
